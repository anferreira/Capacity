If the aplicattion throws an MySqlException with the text :
	"Client does not support authentication protocol 
	requested by server; consider upgrading MySQL client"

You have to run the next script :

use myslq;
update user set password=old_password('oldrootpassword') where user='root';
flush privileges;



MySQL 4.1 and up uses an authentication protocol based on a password 
hashing algorithm that is incompatible with that used by older clients.
